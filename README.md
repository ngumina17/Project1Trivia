Project Title: Sustainability Trivia

MOTIVATION:

When this project was first introduced, I knew I wanted to pursue the trivia option. At first I was thinking of doing a Game of Thrones theme or Harry Potter, I then had a 1:1 with our outcomes coach who mentioned I should try and gear my projects towards the industry I would like to begin my software engineering career in. So, I created a trivia game based off of sustainability! A good way for the end user to learn new ways to conserve our planet!

CODE USED:

Plain old HTML, CSS, and Javascript! All I know at the moment!


SCREENSHOTS:
////INSERT SCREENSHOTS HERE//////
While this may be a very simple feature, I was able to get the text to change color once an answer was clicked on, 



FEATURES:

I had some pretty big plans for this project before it was introduced. I wanted to make it super fancy with a bunch of images and animations. I was thinking I could somewhat model it after the memory game we had to complete as pre-course work prior the cohort beginning. 


INSTRUCTIONS ON USE:
The game is pretty black and white. The opening page will display the title of the game and a "Begin" button. After clicking the "Begin" button, the user will be prompted to answer some questions. 

Sadly, for the life of me, I could not figure out how to implement a score tracker of some sort. But, the text of the answers will turn red or green once you choose an answer letting you know if you were correct or not.
